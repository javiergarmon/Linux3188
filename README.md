Linux3188

Finally a complete kernel build.

Build tested on MK802IV, config file updated

========
Linux Source - RK3188 - PicUntu

We are making progress.

The current code works... for developers though.

The development team is working hard to get this working for normal users as well.

Thanks to Galland, the Linux console and the MALI support is operational.

More updates soon...
